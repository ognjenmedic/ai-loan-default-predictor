  <h2 class="project-heading">About This Project</h2>
  <p>
    This demo app showcases a deployed
    <strong>Machine Learning (ML) pipeline</strong> for loan default prediction.
    It is trained entirely on <strong>synthetic data</strong> that mimics
    realistic applicant profiles. Below, youâ€™ll find details on how to use it,
    explore the code, and understand its key features.

  <h3 class="project-subheading">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

  <ol class="project-list">
    <li>
      <strong>What is this project?</strong>
      <br />
      This is a <strong>machine learning demo app</strong> built using
      <strong>Python (Flask), Angular, and LightGBM</strong>. It predicts loan
      default risk based on user inputs, using a model trained on fully
      <strong>synthetic data</strong> generated by custom scripts. <br /><br />
      While the project structure was originally inspired by open-source credit
      risk challenges, it does
      <strong>not use any real-world or proprietary datasets</strong>. It is
      intended solely for educational and portfolio demonstration purposes.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>How does this app work?</strong>
      <br />
      - Enter loan-related details or click
      <strong>"Generate Test Data"</strong> to auto-fill fields.
      <br />
      - Click <strong>"Predict Default"</strong> to get a probability score of
      default risk.
      <br />
      - The backend Flask API receives the input, uses a pre-trained LightGBM
      model (trained on synthetic data), and returns a prediction.
