# AI Loan Default Predictor App

An end-to-end machine learning application that predicts loan default risk using **fully synthetic data**.  
Built with a Flask API serving a LightGBM model, and an Angular frontend for interactive input and real-time prediction.

**Live Demo**: [ai.fullstackista.com/ai-loan-default-predictor](https://ai.fullstackista.com/ai-loan-default-predictor)

## Project Overview

This app simulates a real-world loan default prediction tool, allowing users to:

- Input realistic applicant details (synthetically generated or manual entry)
- Trigger a pre-trained ML model
- View a predicted default probability score

The backend model is trained entirely on **synthetic data generated via a custom Python script** (see below).  
No real-world or proprietary datasets are used.

## Synthetic Data Generation

All data used in this app is generated from scratch using randomization and simulation logic.  
Feature distributions are inspired by public credit datasets, but no actual data is used.

## Disclaimer

All data used in this application is fully synthetic.

Feature names follow a realistic structure commonly seen in credit scoring datasets,  
but all values are generated from scratch using custom simulation scripts.  
No real-world, proprietary, or competition datasets are used or referenced.
